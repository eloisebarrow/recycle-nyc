# Project Goal

I will build an app that lets users input a location (within the five boroughs of NYC) and find public recycling facilities in that area.

# MVP

Pull data from NYC's Open Data API 'Public Recycling Bins'
Create a form where users can submit a borough name and retrieve data from that borough
Return data based on user input

# PostMVP

Include a map to visualize the locations of the recycling bins

# API Description

The 'Public Recycling Bins' API is a dataset that offers latitude/longitude coordinates for public recycling bins throughout the five boroughs. The data is fairly straightforward: in addition to lat/long coordinates, it provides the borough name, address, park site name and site type.

Here is a sample of what the data looks like when returned: https://res.cloudinary.com/eloise/image/upload/v1566523488/recycle-nyc-dataset.png
